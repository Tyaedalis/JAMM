*Because it's asking for one.*

Purpose
-------

This might eventually turn into a (semi-)playable computer game. It will aim to be a sort of dungeon crawler with RPG elements.

Notes
-----

The *DefaultConfig.x* file should be put in the working directory. I'll probably move it so you don't have to worry about updating it later.
